{"name":"SamSans Tic-Tac-Toe","tagline":"","body":"### Hello Everyone,\r\nCheck out this browser based game that I created.  \r\n###[SamSans Tic-Tac-Toe](http://141sameer261093.github.io/SamSans-Tic-Tac-Toe/)\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting edit of the classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe (also called as 3-in-a-row).   \r\nThe classic version has very limited outcomes. So It becomes un-interesting very soon. But this elegant edit changes it all.. :)\r\n\r\nSo the basic Idea is as follows:   \r\nThe 'Main-Board' is usual 3x3 board. But every 1x1 box in this 'Main-Board' is a 3x3 'Sub-Board' in itself. To put a mark in the box of a Main-Board you have to win the corresponding 'Sub-Board' first. :)   \r\nThis is not the only trick! Players are not allowed to play any random Sub-Boards. The Sub-Board where current player can put mark is decided by other players previous mark! This simple trick makes the game very interesting.     \r\n(This is link to a [Quora Article](http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-hack-edit-to-make-the-boring-Tic-Tac-Toe-game-more-interesting). The answer by 'Anonymous' describes the Idea and Rules thoroughly.)\r\n\r\nHave fun playing the Game.. :)     \r\nAlso, comment on the page, give [suggestions/improvisations](http://141sameer261093.github.io/) if any.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"quora-content-embed\" data-name=\"Whats-the-best-hack-edit-to-make-the-boring-Tic-Tac-Toe-game-more-interesting/answers/2884066\">Read <a class=\"quora-content-link\" data-width=\"700\" load-full-answer=\"True\" data-key=\"bfc8dd1721a8bf89e240c16bd3648669\" data-id=\"2884066\" data-embed=\"uuflmfp\" href=\"http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-hack-edit-to-make-the-boring-Tic-Tac-Toe-game-more-interesting/answers/2884066\" data-type=\"answer\" data-height=\"250\">Anonymous&#039; <a href=\"/Whats-the-best-hack-edit-to-make-the-boring-Tic-Tac-Toe-game-more-interesting#ans2884066\">answer</a> to <a href=\"/Whats-the-best-hack-edit-to-make-the-boring-Tic-Tac-Toe-game-more-interesting\" ref=\"canonical\">What&#039;s the best hack/edit to make the boring Tic-Tac-Toe game more interesting?</a></a> on <a href=\"http://www.quora.com\">Quora</a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.quora.com/widgets/content\"></script></span>\r\n      \r\n\r\nFind out more about me on [SamSans Blog](http://141sameer261093.github.io/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
