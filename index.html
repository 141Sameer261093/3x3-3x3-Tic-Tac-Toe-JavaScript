<p>It is an interesting edit of the classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe (also called as 3-in-a-row).<br>
The classic version has very limited outcomes. So It becomes un-interesting very soon. But this elegant edit changes it all.. :)</p>

<p>So the basic Idea is as follows:<br>
The 'Main-Board' is usual 3x3 board. But every 1x1 box in this 'Main-Board' is a 3x3 'Sub-Board' in itself. To put a mark in the box of a Main-Board you have to win the corresponding 'Sub-Board' first. :)<br>
This is not the only trick! Players are not allowed to play any random Sub-Boards. The Sub-Board where current player can put mark is decided by other players previous mark! This simple trick makes the game very interesting.<br>

<p>Have fun playing the Game.. :)<br>
