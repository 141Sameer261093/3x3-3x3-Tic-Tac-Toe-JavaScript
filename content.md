### Hello Everyone,
Check out this browser based game that I created.
###[SamSans Tic-Tac-Toe](http://141sameer261093.github.io/SamSans-Tic-Tac-Toe/) (link to play the game.)


It is an interesting edit of the classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe (also called as 3-in-a-row).
The classic version has very limited outcomes. So It becomes un-interesting very soon. But this elegant edit changes it all.. :)

So the basic Idea is as follows:
The 'Main-Board' is usual 3x3 board. But every 1x1 box in this 'Main-Board' is a 3x3 'Sub-Board' in itself. To put a mark in the box of a Main-Board you have to win the corresponding 'Sub-Board' first. :)
This is not the only trick! Players are not allowed to play any random Sub-Boards. The Sub-Board where current player can put mark is decided by other players previous mark! This simple trick makes the game very interesting.
(This is link to a [Quora Article](http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-hack-edit-to-make-the-boring-Tic-Tac-Toe-game-more-interesting). The answer by 'Anonymous' describes the Idea and Rules thoroughly.)

Have fun playing the Game.. :)
Also, comment on the page, give [suggestions/improvisations](http://141sameer261093.github.io/) if any.
